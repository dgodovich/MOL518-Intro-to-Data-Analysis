        "In some cases, life is simple. For example, we expect bacteria to undergo exponential growth; enzymes to have Michaelis-Menten kinetics; ligands to bind based on the Hill equation. Deviations from these expectations are interesting as they suggest that additional regulation is going on!\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no one-size-fits-all approach to model selection, the best approach is to try several possible models and see which one is best. Here are some key criteria to use:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Goodness of fit.** We discussed this above, it is typically measured using $R^2$, or the sum of squared error.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model complexity and parsimony.** Parsimony means to favor simpler models that achieve a good fit, based on the principle of Occam's Razor. Cross-validation is also a helpful way to make sure your model is general enough and not just overfit to your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpretability.** It is good to start with models that align with the underlying theory. It is especially helpful if the model has parameters that are interpretable (e.g., doulbing time for exponential growth, or $K_M$ for Michaelis-Menten, or the Hill coefficient).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Residual analysis.** As discussed earlier, ideally the residuals shold be normally distributed with a mean of zero. There shouldn't be any obvious patterns to the residuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Outliers.** Sometimes we encounter outliers in our data. It's important to figure out if they are due to errors, or if they are genuine observations that are very different from the norm.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Practical considerations.** Some algorithms may be impractical to run depending on your computational resources and the size of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "AIC, mentioned above, integrates goodness of fit and model complexity, so is often a good choice to prevent overfitting by penalizing models with more parameters."
