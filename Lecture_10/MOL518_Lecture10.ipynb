We can then calculate our desired statistic (for example, the mean) on each of the resamples, generating a distribution of means.\n",

That said, you can use bootstrapping even with smaller samples, even as low as 10-15 samples. Just know that the performance will not be as good as with a larger sample size (the error will be larger).\n",

        "2. Are there any other assumptions baked into boostrapping? Yes! it is also important that the samples are *independent and are coming from the same distribution*, as this is a key assumption of the bootstrapping approach. In statistics we often refer to this as being independent and identically distributed or i.i.d. for short.\n",

How many times to I need to do the resampling? *More is better, but 1,000-10,000 resamples is usually enough to give a good estimate of the standard error.* There is a bit of a tradeoff here between computing time and accuracy, so if it takes a very long time to compute 10,000 resamples, you can reduce the number of resamples."
